# DevsProjects
Welcome ðŸ˜‰

This open source project was made mainly for Developers who are looking to showcase their projects and creativity to serve as inspiration for their peer developers who are looking for ideas, concepts and examples of what can be built.

## Contribute with your project

1. Fork this repository 
2. Go to developers-projects/components/data.js
3. Add yourself under this format 
```  
{
  projectName:  'Guitar',
  projectURL:  'https://guitar-player.netlify.app/',
  shortDescription:  'Play with a Virtual Guitar',
  developerName:  'Netaniel Wahnich',
  emoji:  'ðŸŽ¸',
  backgroundColor:  'black'
  },
 ```

4. For the **Emoji** you can use this page https://emojipedia.org/ 
Find the one that you like the most or describe your project ðŸ¤¯.
5. For the **Background Color** choose the color you like, can be HEX, RGB or plain word accepted on CSS. In case you're using HEX make sure to add the hashtag (#) like this ðŸ‘‰"#ffd700" the same goes to RGB ðŸ‘‰"rgb(0, 128, 0)".
6. Once you finish filling your data paste it randomly on the array (either way the array is going to be mixed).
7. Don't change anything else, we don't like bugs, right!
8. Once you finish just make a **Push Request** and we will verify that everything is correctly.
9.  Now go enjoy and look what others developers are creating ðŸ˜œ.

If you have multiple projects don't be shy and upload them. Thank you helping this community to grow ðŸ˜Ž.
